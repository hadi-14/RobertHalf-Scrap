**Project Overview**

This project aims to scrape job listing information from a specific website, https://www.roberthalf.ca/en/jobs, using web automation with Selenium in Python. The project involves navigating through multiple pages of job listings, extracting relevant details from each job listing, and saving this data to a CSV file for further analysis.

**What We Did for This Project**

1. **Imports**: The project starts with importing necessary libraries, including Selenium for web automation, ChromeDriverManager for managing the Chrome WebDriver, time for controlling timing, and CSV for handling data storage.
2. **`get_driver()` Function**: A function named `get_driver()` is defined to set up a Selenium WebDriver. This function configures the WebDriver with specific options and opens a given URL.
3. **`scrap()` Function**: The `scrap()` function is created to extract job details from the current web page. It uses XPath expressions to locate and retrieve the following information:

   - Position
   - Job Type
   - Location
   - Salary
   - Job Description
   - Job Requirements
   - Qualifications
4. **`save_csv()` Function**: Another function, `save_csv()`, is defined to save the scraped data to a CSV file. It appends data to the CSV file, adding a header row if the file is empty or creating a new file if it doesn't exist.
5. **Main Script**: The main part of the script utilizes the WebDriver to navigate through multiple pages of job listings and scrape data from each listing. The script uses a loop to iterate through the job listing pages. It collects job details using the `scrap()` function, then saves this data to a CSV file using the `save_csv()` function. The total count of scraped job listings is maintained for further analytics.

**Project Results**

The project successfully scrapes job listings from the specified website and saves the job details into a CSV file. It navigates through multiple pages of job listings, extracts various attributes, and ensures data is correctly appended to the CSV file.
